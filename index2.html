<h1 align=center><p>This is a simple website giving you more details on the 2nd Gen Toyota 4Runner. This truck was produced from 1990 thru 1995. Engine options were a 3.0L V6, commonly known as the 3VZ-E, which made about 150 horsepower and 180lb ft of torque. The other engine, the 2.4L 4 cylinder known as the 22-RE made about 115 horsepower and 135lb ft of torque. Both engines were quite underpowered, but also reliable. The 3VZ-E commonly had head gaskets which failed, and the problem never seemed to occur again after replacing them. Both engine options had a 5 speed manual or 4 speed automatic transmission available. The 2nd gen 4runner is quite comfortable and extremely capable off road - as capable as a Jeep Wrangler if properly equipped. Click on the links below for more information. </p>
